# Calories-Burned-Prediction

## About
Our project is to create an application that predicts the calories burned during a workout, based on factors like age, gender, height, weight, and exercise duration. This can help users to track their health and fitness goals, and get useful information and insights. We use linear regression, a supervised machine learning technique that finds the best-fit line between the input and output variables. Linear regression is simple and powerful, and can capture the linear relationship between variables and make accurate predictions. We will show how linear regression works, how we use it on our dataset, and how we measure its performance. 

## Methodology
We used Python and the following libraries to implement our solution:
NumPy: for scientific computing and linear algebra
pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
seaborn: for statistical data visualization
pickle: for saving and loading the model
sklearn: for machine learning and data preprocessing

We used linear regression, a supervised machine learning technique that can find the best-fit line between the input features and the output target. We followed the steps of data collection, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and testing.
